# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project involves developing a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid techniques. 
The system can recommend movies based on user preferences or similarities between movies.
I've considered Movielens dataset [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushimishra2809/movielens-dataset ] from kaggle.
GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org). The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set.
The data consists of 105339 ratings applied over 10329 movies. The average rating is 3.5 and minimum and maximum rating is 0.5 and 5 respectively. There are 668 user who has given their ratings for 149532 movies.
